            <p>
                My name is Marley Jenkins and I graduated from Winthrop University with a degree in Digital information Design and a cocnentration in Web Application Development. 
                My major was  combination of both Computer Science and Design.  I attended Winthrop because I was able to find a major that combined both of my interests. 
                There, I was able to gain user experience, design, and backend web development skills.     
                <br/>
                During my time at Winthrop, I was always challenged with projects that helped me to step out of my comfort zone as a Web Designer. 
                I applied these these skills and help out around my community back in Charleston. 
                Moreover, I was granted incredible opportunities, such as conducting mentored-lead research, participant in coding events, and create side projects in my spare time.
